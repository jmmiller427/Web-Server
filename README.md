# Web-Server
Given TCP socket code already to start up a simple web server, I had to handle what file the user was looking for when they accessed the server. Then if the file was found it was then sent with a proper HTTP header and the data itself. 
All of my edits to the code given in class were made to HandleTCPClient.c
This program creates a simple web server able of sending html, txt, jpg and gif files.
